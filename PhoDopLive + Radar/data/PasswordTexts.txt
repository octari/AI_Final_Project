My voice is my password
OK Google
Only lawyers love millionaires
Artificial intelligence is for real
Birthday parties have cupcakes and ice cream
Actions speak louder than words
There is no such thing as a free lunch
A watched pot never boils
Jealousy has twenty twenty vision
Necessity is the mother of invention
